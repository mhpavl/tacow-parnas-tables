# Parnas Tables in Swift

A presentation and practical walkthrough demonstrating how to apply Parnas Tables to Swift development, presented at tacow (Toronto Area Cocoa and WebObjects meetup) on November 12, 2025.

## Overview

This repository contains educational materials on using Parnas Tables, a formal specification technique developed by David Parnas, in Swift. Parnas Tables provide a structured way to document software behavior, making complex decision logic clearer and more maintainable.

## 🚀 Level Up Your Software Quality

Interested in applying Parnas Tables and other formal methods to improve your software quality? I help companies build more maintainable, verifiable, and robust codebases through proven software engineering techniques.

## Contents

### Presentation

The core presentation is available in two formats:

- **[PDF Format](Slides/TACOW%20-%20Parnas%20Tables%20To%20Swift.pdf)** - Portable document for easy viewing and sharing
- **[HTML Format](Slides/TACOW%20-%20Parnas%20Tables%20To%20Swift/index.html)** - Interactive web-based presentation (download and open in a browser)

### Interactive Playground

- **[Swift Playground](Playground/ParnasTables.playground)** - Hands-on walkthrough with executable Swift code

To use the playground:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Playground/ParnasTables.playground` in Xcode
3. Follow along with the examples and experiments

## Getting Started

1. **Read the presentation** to understand the theory behind Parnas tables
2. **Open the playground** in Xcode to see practical Swift implementations
3. **Experiment** with the code examples to solidify your understanding

## What are Parnas Tables?

Parnas tables are a tabular specification method that helps document:
- Complex conditional logic
- State-based behavior
- Decision-making processes

By using tables instead of nested if-statements or complex boolean expressions, you can create more maintainable and verifiable code.

## Requirements

- Xcode
- macOS
- PDF reader or modern web browser (for the presentation)
